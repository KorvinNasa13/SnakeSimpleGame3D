## âœ¨ About the Project

I'm using different approaches and patterns to demonstrate my skills in C#. 
During development, I've often used AI as a mentor for complex explanations.

> **Status:** Work in progress  
> The project is still being developed, so there may be unused elements.  
> More features and bug fixes are planned!
